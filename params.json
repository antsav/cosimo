We had fixed dimensions for pages that once defined did not change.  The pages could be folded or crumpled, but the content on those pages retained its original form, staying true to the predefined dimensions of the page.<br>\r\nFast forward 550 years and the first web browser born. With it, a new medium to display and interact with information. A new layout with new dimensions - pixels instead of millimeters, and an endless canvas - scrolling. Jump ahead 17 years and we are graced with the first revolutionary mobile device - the iPhone, giving us the ability to bring the internet with us where ever we go.<br>\r\nToday, as mobile (phone and tablet) device diversification continues, we require the content to be flexible and cater to current and future devices. Yet we still use a foundational system that is over 500 years old, and which was built for a completely different world - the physical.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n## The Intiative\r\nThe Cosimo Initiative takes learnings from the physical print world and adapts them to that of the digital. The elemental essence of typefaces, spacing, leading (line height) and hierarchy are combined with the scalability of the web.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n#### What does this mean?\r\nThe framework has taken individual components (input fields, dropdowns, buttons, what have you) and defined how they interact with one another and the medium they are displayed on. We stepped away from using pixels to define the components, using just rems and ems set from a base font-size.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!---\r\n##### Sources of inspiration\r\nDev Tips - <a href = \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHf3aQz50jQ\">REM or EM — What should I use??</a><br>\r\nStudio Thick - <a href = \"http://megatype.studiothick.com/\">MegaType</a><br>\r\nStudio Thick - <a href=\"http://www.studiothick.com/essays/web-typography-is-broken/\">Web typography is broken.
